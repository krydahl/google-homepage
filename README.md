Creating dummy of google page for practise based on odin project. http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav

What did I learn?

Positioning remains a challenge - especially horizontal and vertical centering.
It seems like solutions work randomly. In truth solutions work differently depending on whether
the element is block or inline and you need to make sure you're applying things to the right element
too. I still don't understand the complexities here as well as I'd like.
